# Document Processor Documentation

## 1. Overview and Purpose

The `document_processor` module is designed to process insurance documents and extract structured information from them. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze the content of documents, identify relevant data points, and format the extracted information according to predefined schemas. This module is essential for automating the extraction of critical information from large volumes of insurance documents, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy in data handling.

## 2. Architecture and Design Decisions

The `document_processor` module is structured around several key components:

- **DocumentProcessor**: The core class that orchestrates the processing of documents. It integrates various sub-components to perform NLP and ML tasks, manage schemas, and format output.

- **NLPModel**: A component responsible for performing natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.

- **MLModel**: A machine learning component used for predictive tasks and classification within the document processing workflow.

- **SchemaManager**: Manages the schemas that define the structure of the extracted information, ensuring consistency and compliance with business requirements.

- **OutputFormatter**: Formats the extracted data into a structured format suitable for downstream applications or storage.

### Design Decisions

- **Modularity**: The system is designed with modular components to ensure flexibility and ease of maintenance. Each component has a specific responsibility, allowing for independent updates and testing.

- **Scalability**: The architecture supports scalability by allowing the integration of more advanced NLP and ML models as needed, without significant changes to the overall system.

- **Error Handling and Logging**: Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented to facilitate troubleshooting and ensure robust operation.

## 3. API Reference with Examples

### DocumentProcessor Class

#### `__init__()`

Initializes the `DocumentProcessor` with its sub-components.

#### `process_document(document: str) -> dict`

Processes a document to extract structured information.

- **Args**:
  - `document` (str): The raw text of the insurance document.

- **Returns**:
  - `dict`: A dictionary containing the structured information extracted from the document.

**Example Usage**:

```python
processor = DocumentProcessor()
document_text = "Sample insurance document text."
structured_data = processor.process_document(document_text)
print(structured_data)
```

## 4. Configuration and Deployment Guidelines

### Configuration

- **Logging**: The logging level is set to `INFO` by default. This can be adjusted in the `logging.basicConfig` call to suit different environments (e.g., `DEBUG` for development).

- **Model Integration**: Ensure that the NLP and ML models are properly configured and trained before deployment. The models should be accessible to the `DocumentProcessor` class.

### Deployment

- **Environment**: The module should be deployed in an environment with access to necessary computational resources for NLP and ML tasks.

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed, including any specific libraries required by the NLP and ML models.

- **Scalability**: Consider deploying the module within a microservices architecture to handle increased loads and facilitate scaling.

## 5. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Maintenance

- **Model Updates**: Regularly update the NLP and ML models to incorporate new data and improve accuracy.

- **Schema Management**: Review and update schemas as business requirements evolve to ensure extracted data remains relevant and useful.

### Troubleshooting

- **Logging**: Utilize the logging output to diagnose issues. Adjust the logging level to `DEBUG` for more detailed output during troubleshooting.

- **Error Handling**: Review error messages and stack traces to identify and resolve issues. Ensure that all exceptions are properly caught and logged.

- **Testing**: Run unit tests regularly to ensure the integrity of the module. Update tests as new features are added or existing features are modified.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `document_processor` module, detailing its purpose, architecture, usage, and maintenance guidelines to facilitate effective deployment and operation.
