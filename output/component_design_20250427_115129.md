## Generated Result

To design the `graph_schema` component for the Insurance Graph RAG System, we need to focus on requirements related to building, maintaining, and evolving the knowledge graph schema. This component is crucial for ensuring that the system can adapt to new document types and maintain accurate representations of insurance data. Below is a detailed design for the `graph_schema` component.

### 1. Class/Module Structure with Descriptions

1. **GraphSchemaManager**
   - **Description**: Manages the creation, updating, and versioning of the knowledge graph schema. Handles schema evolution and ensures compliance with domain constraints.

2. **SchemaVersionControl**
   - **Description**: Manages versioning and change history of the schema, allowing rollback and audit of schema changes.

3. **ConstraintValidator**
   - **Description**: Validates schema changes against predefined domain constraints to ensure integrity and compliance.

4. **EntityRelationshipDetector**
   - **Description**: Detects and incorporates new entity and relationship types into the schema using machine learning models.

### 2. Core Functions/Methods with Parameters and Return Types

1. **GraphSchemaManager**

   - `create_schema(document_types: List[str]) -> Dict`
     - **Description**: Initializes the schema based on provided document types.
     - **Parameters**: `document_types` - List of document types to include in the schema.
     - **Return Type**: Dictionary representing the initial schema.

   - `update_schema(changes: Dict) -> bool`
     - **Description**: Updates the schema with new changes.
     - **Parameters**: `changes` - Dictionary of changes to apply to the schema.

     - **Return Type**: Dictionary representing the current schema.

2. **SchemaVersionControl**

   - `commit_schema_version(schema: Dict) -> str`
     - **Description**: Commits a new version of the schema.
     - **Parameters**: `schema` - The schema to commit.
     - **Return Type**: String representing the version ID.

   - `rollback_schema(version_id: str) -> bool`
     - **Description**: Rolls back the schema to a previous version.
     - **Parameters**: `version_id` - The ID of the version to rollback to.
     - **Return Type**: Boolean indicating success or failure.

3. **ConstraintValidator**

   - `validate_constraints(schema: Dict) -> bool`
     - **Description**: Validates the schema against domain constraints.
     - **Parameters**: `schema` - The schema to validate.
     - **Return Type**: Boolean indicating if the schema is valid.

4. **EntityRelationshipDetector**

     - **Description**: Detects new relationships in a document.
     - **Parameters**: `document` - The document to analyze.
     - **Return Type**: List of tuples representing relationships.

### 3. Data Structures and Schemas

- **Schema Representation (Dict)**
  ```json
  {
    "entities": {
      "Policy": {
        "attributes": ["policy_number", "effective_date", "expiry_date"],
        "relationships": ["covers", "excludes"]
      },
      "Coverage": {
        "attributes": ["coverage_type", "limit"],
        "relationships": ["applies_to"]
      }
    },
    "relationships": {
      "covers": {
        "from": "Policy",
        "to": "Coverage"
      },
      "excludes": {
        "from": "Policy",
        "to": "Exclusion"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 4. Error Handling Approach

- **Validation Errors**: Use custom exceptions like `SchemaValidationError` to handle constraint violations.
- **Version Control Errors**: Implement `VersionControlError` for issues during schema versioning.
- **Detection Errors**: Use `EntityDetectionError` and `RelationshipDetectionError` for issues in detecting new entities and relationships.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use dictionaries and sets for fast lookups and updates in schema management.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed schema versions to reduce retrieval time.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing for entity and relationship detection to improve performance on large documents.
- **Scalability**: Design the schema management system to handle large and complex schemas by using scalable storage solutions like graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

This design ensures that the `graph_schema` component is robust, adaptable, and capable of handling the dynamic nature of insurance documents and their associated data.
