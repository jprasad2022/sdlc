Analyze the following customer query to extract intents, entities, and parameters relevant to an insurance RAG system:

Query: {query_text}

Instructions:
1. Identify the primary intent category from:
   - policy_details (information about policies)
   - coverage_inquiry (what is covered)
   - claim_status (status of claims)
   - premium_information (payments, costs)
   - filing_claim (how to submit a claim)
   - definition_inquiry (meaning of terms)
   - other (specify if none of the above apply)
   - policy_details (information about policies)
   - coverage_inquiry (what is covered)
   - claim_status (status of claims)
   - premium_information (payments, costs)
   - filing_claim (how to submit a claim)
   - definition_inquiry (meaning of terms)
   - other (specify if none of the above apply)

2. Extract key entities from:
   - policy_number (e.g., P12345)
   - claim_number (e.g., CL4001)
   - policy_type (auto, home, health, etc.)
   - coverage_type (liability, collision, flood, etc.)
   - dates (effective dates, expiration dates, loss dates)
   - amounts (limits, deductibles, premiums)

3. Determine context requirements:
   - Does the query require user context to answer?
   - What specific context would be needed?
   - Is there implied context in the query?

4. Assess query complexity:
   - Simple (single intent, clear entities)
   - Moderate (clear intent, ambiguous entities)
   - Complex (multiple intents or complex relationships)

Format your response as a structured JSON object with:
- primary_intent: string (one of the categories)
- confidence: float (0.0-1.0)
- entities: object with extracted parameters
- required_context: array of strings
- complexity: string (simple/moderate/complex)
- reasoning: brief explanation of your analysis
