Given the current graph schema and instance data, recommend schema evolution changes to better represent the insurance domain knowledge.

Current Schema:
{current_schema}

Instance Data Example:
{instance_data}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the instance data against the current schema

3. Identify missing properties on existing entity types
4. Identify new relationship types that should be modeled
5. Suggest refinements to existing relationship definitions
6. Consider insurance-specific constraints (regulatory, business rules)

Provide:
1. Recommended new entity types with properties
2. Recommended property additions to existing entities
3. Recommended new relationship types
4. Schema evolution strategy (additive vs. transformative)
5. Risk assessment of proposed changes
6. Migration considerations for existing data
