## Generated Result

To design the `document_processor` component, we need to focus on the requirements related to processing insurance documents to extract structured information. This involves using NLP and ML techniques to extract entities, relationships, and numerical data from diverse insurance documents. Below is a detailed design of the `document_processor` component:

### 1. Class/Module Structure with Descriptions

1. **DocumentProcessor**
   - **Description:** Core class responsible for processing insurance documents and extracting structured information.
   
2. **NLPModel**
   - **Description:** Handles natural language processing tasks such as entity extraction and relationship mapping using NLP techniques.
   
3. **MLModel**
   - **Description:** Utilizes machine learning models to classify and recognize new entities and relationships.
   
4. **SchemaManager**
   - **Description:** Manages the dynamic schema generation and version control for the extracted data.
   
5. **OutputFormatter**
   - **Description:** Formats the extracted data into various output formats such as text, structured data, and visualizations.

### 2. Core Functions/Methods with Parameters and Return Types

1. **DocumentProcessor.process_document(document: str) -> dict**
   - **Description:** Main method to process a document and extract structured information.
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `document`: The raw text of the insurance document.
   - **Returns:** 
     - A dictionary containing extracted entities and relationships.

2. **NLPModel.extract_entities(text: str) -> List[dict]**

   - **Parameters:** 
     - `text`: The text from which to extract entities.
   - **Returns:** 
     - A list of dictionaries representing extracted entities.

3. **NLPModel.map_relationships(entities: List[dict]) -> List[dict]**
   - **Description:** Maps relationships between extracted entities.
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `entities`: A list of extracted entities.
   - **Returns:** 
     - A list of dictionaries representing relationships.

   - **Parameters:** 
     - `entities`: A list of entities to classify.
   - **Returns:** 
     - A list of classified entities.

5. **SchemaManager.update_schema(entities: List[dict], relationships: List[dict]) -> None**
   - **Description:** Updates the schema based on new entities and relationships.
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `entities`: A list of entities.

     - `format_type`: The desired output format (e.g., 'text', 'json', 'visualization').
   - **Returns:** 
     - Formatted data in the specified format.

### 3. Data Structures and Schemas

- **Entity Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "entity_id": "string",
    "entity_type": "string",
    "attributes": {
      "attribute_name": "value"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Relationship Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "relationship_id": "string",
    "source_entity_id": "string",
    "target_entity_id": "string",
    "relationship_type": "string"
  }
  ```

- **Schema Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "version": "string",
    "entities": ["entity_type"],
    "relationships": ["relationship_type"]
  }
  ```

### 4. Error Handling Approach

- **Validation Errors:** Ensure input documents are valid and non-empty. Raise exceptions for invalid inputs.
- **Extraction Errors:** Implement try-catch blocks around NLP and ML operations to handle unexpected extraction failures.
- **Schema Update Errors:** Validate schema changes against domain constraints and log errors if constraints are violated.
- **Output Formatting Errors:** Handle unsupported format types gracefully by returning a default format or error message.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Algorithms:** Use optimized NLP and ML algorithms to minimize processing time.
- **Batch Processing:** Implement batch processing for handling multiple documents simultaneously.
- **Caching:** Use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce redundant computations.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilize parallel processing and multi-threading to improve throughput and reduce latency.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to scale horizontally by distributing workloads across multiple instances in a cloud environment.
