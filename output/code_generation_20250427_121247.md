## Generated Result

To design the `query_processor` component for the Insurance Graph RAG System, we need to focus on the requirements related to processing sophisticated natural language queries, providing accurate and contextual responses, and ensuring high system performance. Below is a detailed design:

### 1. Class/Module Structure with Descriptions

1. **QueryProcessor**
   - **Description:** Main class responsible for handling and processing user queries. It interfaces with the knowledge graph and NLP components to interpret queries and generate responses.

2. **NLPInterpreter**
   - **Description:** Sub-module responsible for natural language processing tasks such as intent recognition and entity extraction.

3. **KnowledgeGraphInterface**
   - **Description:** Handles interactions with the knowledge graph, including querying and updating the graph.

4. **ResponseGenerator**
   - **Description:** Constructs responses based on query results, ensuring they are contextual and include necessary citations.

5. **PerformanceMonitor**
   - **Description:** Monitors the performance of the query processing pipeline to ensure low response times and high accuracy.

### 2. Core Functions/Methods with Parameters and Return Types

1. **QueryProcessor.process_query(query: str) -> dict**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `query`: The natural language query input by the user.
   - **Return Type:** 
     - A dictionary containing the response and any relevant metadata.

2. **NLPInterpreter.interpret(query: str) -> dict**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `query`: The natural language query.
   - **Return Type:** 
     - A dictionary containing extracted intents and entities.

3. **KnowledgeGraphInterface.query_graph(intent: str, entities: dict) -> dict**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `intent`: The identified intent of the query.
     - `entities`: A dictionary of entities extracted from the query.
   - **Return Type:** 
     - A dictionary containing the results from the knowledge graph.

4. **ResponseGenerator.generate_response(graph_results: dict) -> dict**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `graph_results`: The results obtained from querying the knowledge graph.
   - **Return Type:** 
     - A dictionary containing the final response text and citations.

5. **PerformanceMonitor.log_performance(metrics: dict) -> None**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `metrics`: A dictionary containing performance metrics such as response time and accuracy.
   - **Return Type:** 
     - None

### 3. Data Structures and Schemas

- **QueryResult**
  - **Fields:**
    - `response_text`: str
    - `citations`: List[str]
    - `metadata`: dict

- **IntentEntityMapping**
  - **Fields:**
    - `intent`: str
    - `entities`: dict

- **PerformanceMetrics**
  - **Fields:**
    - `response_time`: float
    - `accuracy`: float

### 4. Error Handling Approach

- **Input Validation:** Ensure that the input query is not empty and conforms to expected formats.
- **Exception Handling:** Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions during NLP processing, graph querying, and response generation.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism to provide a generic response or request clarification if the query cannot be processed.
- **Logging:** Log errors with detailed information for debugging and analysis.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently asked queries to reduce processing time.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations, especially when querying the knowledge graph.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute queries across multiple instances of the query processor to handle high loads.
- **Optimization:** Optimize NLP models and graph queries for speed and efficiency.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance and adjust resources as needed to maintain SLA compliance.

This design ensures that the `query_processor` component is robust, efficient, and capable of handling complex queries while providing accurate and contextual responses.


Requirements:
1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Include comprehensive docstrings
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Add appropriate unit tests
5. Consider edge cases in the implementation
