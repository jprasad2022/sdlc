# Insurance Graph RAG System - Project Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the automated software development lifecycle for the Insurance Graph RAG System, demonstrating the use of Generative AI throughout the process.

## Development Process

The system was designed and developed using a GenAI-driven approach, with the following phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Extracted user stories and functional/non-functional requirements
2. **Architecture Design**: Generated high-level system architecture and component structure
3. **Component Design**: Detailed design for each system component
4. **Code Generation**: Implemented production-ready code for all components
5. **Test Generation**: Created comprehensive test suites
6. **Documentation Generation**: Produced detailed documentation
