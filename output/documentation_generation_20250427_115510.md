# Query Processor Documentation

## Overview and Purpose

The `query_processor` module is designed to handle and process user queries efficiently. It serves as a central component in an AI-driven system, responsible for interpreting user intents, extracting relevant entities, and generating appropriate responses. The module aims to deliver accurate and timely responses while maintaining a high level of reliability and scalability.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

The `query_processor` module is built with a focus on modularity and extensibility. It consists of several key components:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - **QueryResult**: Encapsulates the response text, citations, and metadata associated with a query response.
   - **IntentEntityMapping**: Represents the mapping between detected intents and their corresponding entities.
   - **PerformanceMetrics**: Tracks performance metrics such as response time and accuracy.

2. **Main Class**:
   - **QueryProcessor**: The core class responsible for processing queries. It utilizes various sub-components to interpret and respond to user inputs.

### Design Decisions

- **Logging**: The module uses Python's built-in logging library to provide insights into its operations, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures that the module can gracefully handle unexpected situations without crashing.
- **Type Annotations**: The use of type annotations improves code readability and helps with static analysis.

## API Reference with Examples

### QueryResult

```python
class QueryResult:
    def __init__(self, response_text: str, citations: List[str], metadata: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Initializes a QueryResult instance.

        :param response_text: The text of the response generated by the query processor.
        :param citations: A list of citations or references related to the response.
        :param metadata: Additional metadata associated with the response.
        """
```

### IntentEntityMapping

```python
class IntentEntityMapping:
    def __init__(self, intent: str, entities: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Initializes an IntentEntityMapping instance.

        :param intent: The detected intent of the user query.
        :param entities: A dictionary of entities extracted from the query.
        """
```

### PerformanceMetrics

```python
class PerformanceMetrics:
    def __init__(self, response_time: float, accuracy: float):
        """
        Initializes a PerformanceMetrics instance.

        :param response_time: The time taken to generate a response.
        :param accuracy: The accuracy of the response generated.
        """
```

### QueryProcessor

```python
class QueryProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes the QueryProcessor instance.
        """
```

#### Example Usage

```python
# Example of using the QueryProcessor
query_processor = QueryProcessor()
query_result = query_processor.process_query("What is the capital of France?")
print(query_result.response_text)
```

## Configuration and Deployment Guidelines

### Configuration

- **Logging Level**: The logging level can be configured by modifying the `basicConfig` level in the logging setup. For production environments, it is recommended to set it to `logging.WARNING` or higher to reduce verbosity.

### Deployment

- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all required Python packages are installed. This can typically be managed using a `requirements.txt` file.
- **Environment**: The module should be deployed in an environment that supports Python 3.6 or higher.

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Maintenance

- **Code Updates**: Regularly update the module to incorporate new features and improvements.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use the logging outputs and performance metrics to monitor the system's performance and make necessary adjustments.

### Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: 
  - **Incorrect Responses**: Check the intent and entity extraction logic for potential improvements.
  - **Performance Bottlenecks**: Analyze the performance metrics to identify slow components and optimize them.

- **Debugging**: Utilize the logging outputs to trace the flow of data and identify where issues may be occurring.

By following this documentation, users can effectively integrate, configure, and maintain the `query_processor` module within their systems, ensuring robust query handling capabilities.
