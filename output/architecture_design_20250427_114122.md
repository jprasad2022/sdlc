# Requirements Analysis for Insurance Graph RAG System
            
You are an expert software requirements analyst with deep knowledge of insurance domain, knowledge graphs, and RAG systems. Your task is to conduct a COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED analysis of the following business requirements for an Insurance Graph RAG system.
            
## Business Requirements:
            
Create a comprehensive insurance domain knowledge graph RAG system that:

1. Processes diverse insurance policy documents (policies, endorsements, claims forms, coverage declarations) to extract structured information including:
   - Entity extraction (policies, coverages, exclusions, limits, policyholders, providers)
   - Relationship mapping (policy-to-coverage relationships, exclusion applicability)
   - Temporal data extraction (effective dates, expiration dates, claim dates)
   - Numerical data extraction (amounts, limits, deductibles, premiums)

2. Builds and maintains a self-evolving knowledge graph schema that:
   - Adapts to new document types and structures
   - Identifies and incorporates new entity and relationship types
   - Validates schema changes against domain constraints
   - Maintains versioning and change history

3. Processes sophisticated natural language queries about:
   - Policy details and coverage specifics
   - Claims processing and status
   - Regulatory compliance verification
   - Coverage comparison and gap analysis
   - Risk assessment and historical patterns

4. Provides accurate, contextual responses that:
   - Cite specific policy sections and clauses
   - Incorporate domain-specific terminology and explanations
   - Address regulatory and compliance considerations
   - Offer multi-format output (text, structured data, visualizations)
