                ## Architectural Context
                ## High-Level System Architecture

The architecture of the Insurance Graph RAG system is designed to efficiently process insurance documents, build and maintain a dynamic knowledge graph, and provide accurate responses to complex queries. The system is divided into several key components, each responsible for specific functionalities.

        """Ingests a document for processing."""
        pass

    def preprocess_document(self, document: str) -> str:
        """Pre-processes the document for further analysis."""
        pass
```

class InformationExtraction:
    def extract_entities(self, document: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Extracts entities from the document."""
        pass

    def extract_relationships(self, document: str) -> List[Tuple[str, str, str]]:
        """Extracts relationships between entities."""
        pass
```

#### KnowledgeGraphManagement

```python
class KnowledgeGraphManagement:
    def build_graph(self, entities: List[Dict[str, Any]], relationships: List[Tuple[str, str, str]]) -> None:
        """Builds the knowledge graph."""
        pass

    def update_graph(self, changes: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:

    def process_query(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Processes a natural language query."""
        pass

    def recognize_intent(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Recognizes the intent of the query."""
        pass
```

#### TemporalNumericalDataExtraction

class TemporalNumericalDataExtraction:
    def extract_temporal_data(self, document: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Extracts temporal data from the document."""
        pass

    def extract_numerical_data(self, document: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Extracts numerical data from the document."""
        pass
```

#### ResponseGeneration

```python
class ResponseGeneration:
    def generate_response(self, query_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Generates a response based on the query result."""
        pass

    def format_response(self, response: str, format_type: str) -> str:
        """Formats the response into the specified format."""
        pass
```

#### ContinuousLearningImprovement

```python
class ContinuousLearningImprovement:
    def train_model(self, data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
        """Trains the model with new data."""
        pass

    def evaluate_performance(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Evaluates the performance of the system."""
        pass
```

    def expose_api(self, endpoint: str, method: str, handler: Callable) -> None:
        """Exposes an API endpoint."""
        pass

    def handle_request(self, request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Handles incoming API requests."""
        pass
```

### 3. Data Structures and Schemas

- **Entity Schema:** `{"id": str, "type": str, "attributes": Dict[str, Any]}`
- **Relationship Schema:** `{"source": str, "target": str, "type": str}`
- **Query Result Schema:** `{"intent": str, "parameters": Dict[str, Any], "confidence": float}`

### 4. Error Handling Approach

- **Logging:** Use a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack) to capture and analyze logs.
- **Exception Handling:** Implement try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Validation:** Validate inputs and outputs at each stage to prevent errors from propagating.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Scalability:** Use distributed systems (e.g., Kafka, Neo4j clusters) to handle large volumes of data.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations, especially in I/O-bound tasks.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute workloads evenly across servers to optimize resource utilization.

This design ensures that the system is modular, with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities, making it scalable and maintainable. Proper error handling and performance optimizations are integrated into the architecture to enhance reliability and efficiency.
