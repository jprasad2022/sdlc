# Requirements Analysis for Insurance Graph RAG System
            
You are an expert software requirements analyst with deep knowledge of insurance domain, knowledge graphs, and RAG systems. Your task is to conduct a COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED analysis of the following business requirements for an Insurance Graph RAG system.
            
## Business Requirements:
            
Create a comprehensive insurance domain knowledge graph RAG system that:

1. Processes diverse insurance policy documents (policies, endorsements, claims forms, coverage declarations) to extract structured information including:
   - Entity extraction (policies, coverages, exclusions, limits, policyholders, providers)
   - Relationship mapping (policy-to-coverage relationships, exclusion applicability)
   - Temporal data extraction (effective dates, expiration dates, claim dates)
   - Numerical data extraction (amounts, limits, deductibles, premiums)

2. Builds and maintains a self-evolving knowledge graph schema that:
   - Adapts to new document types and structures
   - Identifies and incorporates new entity and relationship types
   - Validates schema changes against domain constraints
   - Maintains versioning and change history

3. Processes sophisticated natural language queries about:
   - Policy details and coverage specifics
   - Claims processing and status
   - Regulatory compliance verification
   - Coverage comparison and gap analysis
   - Risk assessment and historical patterns

4. Provides accurate, contextual responses that:
   - Cite specific policy sections and clauses
   - Incorporate domain-specific terminology and explanations
   - Address regulatory and compliance considerations
   - Offer multi-format output (text, structured data, visualizations)

5. Continuously learns and improves through:
   - Automated testing against known insurance scenarios
   - User feedback collection and integration
   - Self-assessment of response quality and accuracy
   - Identification of knowledge gaps and recommendations for improvement
            
## Instructions:

   - Query processing (NLP techniques, intent recognition, parameter extraction)
   - Response generation (templating, personalization, citations)
   - System automation (testing, learning, improvement mechanisms)
   - Integration capabilities (APIs, external systems)

3. Non-functional requirements:
   - Performance metrics and SLAs (response times, throughput, accuracy)
   - Security requirements (data protection, access control, audit)
   - Compliance needs (insurance regulations, data privacy laws)
   - Scalability considerations
   - Reliability and fault tolerance
   - Maintainability and extensibility

4. Data requirements:
   - Required insurance document types
   - Entity types and relationships
   - Data quality standards
   - Storage and retrieval requirements
   - Data lifecycle management

5. Technical constraints and dependencies:
   - Required technologies and frameworks
