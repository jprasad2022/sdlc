# Requirements Analysis: Insurance Graph RAG System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the Insurance Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System. The requirements are derived from a thorough analysis of business needs in the insurance domain and modern AI capabilities.

## Business Goals

1. **Improve Customer Service Efficiency**: Reduce response time for insurance queries by at least 50%
2. **Enhance Information Accuracy**: Ensure responses are based on up-to-date policy information and regulations
3. **Scale Knowledge Operations**: Handle increasing document volumes and query complexity without proportional staffing increases
4. **Reduce Operational Costs**: Lower the cost per query by automating routine information retrieval and response generation
5. **Improve Compliance**: Ensure all responses adhere to regulatory requirements and include necessary disclosures
