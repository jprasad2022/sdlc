## Generated Result

To design the `qa_system` component of the Insurance Graph RAG System, we need to focus on the requirements related to processing sophisticated natural language queries, providing accurate and contextual responses, and integrating with external systems. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the component design:

### 1. Class/Module Structure with Descriptions

1. **QueryProcessor**
   - **Description:** Handles the processing of natural language queries, including parsing and understanding user intent.
   
2. **ResponseGenerator**
   - **Description:** Generates responses based on the processed queries, ensuring they are accurate and contextual with citations.

3. **KnowledgeGraphInterface**
   - **Description:** Interfaces with the knowledge graph to retrieve and update information as needed for query responses.

4. **ExternalAPIIntegrator**
   - **Description:** Manages integration with external APIs to enhance data sources and extend functionality.

5. **FeedbackLoop**
   - **Description:** Collects user feedback to improve system accuracy and performance over time.

### 2. Core Functions/Methods with Parameters and Return Types
