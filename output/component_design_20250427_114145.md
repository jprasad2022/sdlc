### 3. Data Structures and Schemas

- **Document**: Represents raw document data.
- **ProcessedDocument**: Contains preprocessed text data.
- **Entity**: Represents identified entities.
- **Relationship**: Represents relationships between entities.
- **ExtractedData**: Structured data extracted from documents.
- **QueryResult**: Results from querying the knowledge graph.
- **Response**: Generated response to a query.
- **CitedResponse**: Response with added citations.
- **Feedback**: User feedback data.
- **FeedbackAnalysis**: Analysis results of feedback.
- **TrainingData**: Data used for training models.
- **Model**: Machine learning model.
- **PerformanceMetrics**: Metrics for evaluating performance.
- **DataPackage**: Data exchanged with external systems.

### 4. Error Handling Approach

- **Logging**: Implement logging at each module level to capture errors and system events.
- **Exception Handling**: Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry logic for transient errors, especially in network communications.
- **Validation**: Validate inputs and outputs at each stage to prevent propagation of errors.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design modules to be stateless where possible, allowing for horizontal scaling.
- **Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce redundant computations, especially in NLP processing and query results.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement asynchronous processing for tasks like document ingestion and feedback analysis to improve throughput.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workloads evenly across processing units to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and manage resource usage to optimize performance and cost.

This design ensures that the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable, with well-defined interfaces and robust error handling.
