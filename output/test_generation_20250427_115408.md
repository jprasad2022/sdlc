Generate comprehensive test cases for the Insurance Graph RAG system's query_processor component.

Component Details:
{component_details}

Instructions:
1. Create test cases covering all key functionality
2. Include tests for normal operation scenarios
3. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
4. Ensure coverage of insurance-specific scenarios
5. Incorporate domain knowledge about policies, claims, and coverages

Test types to include:
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Mock-based tests for external dependencies
- Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Error handling tests

Insurance domain considerations:
- Policy status transitions (active, expired, cancelled)
- Claim processing scenarios (filing, review, approval, denial)
- Coverage verification for different policy types
- Premium calculation and payment processing
- Regulatory compliance requirements

Format your output as executable Python test code using unittest framework.
```

## Generated Result

To generate comprehensive test cases for the Insurance Graph RAG system's query_processor component, we need to consider various aspects of its functionality, including normal operations, edge cases, and insurance-specific scenarios. Below is a structured approach using Python's `unittest` framework, covering different types of tests as specified.

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

# Assuming the query_processor component has the following functions:
# - process_query(query)
# - verify_coverage(policy_id, coverage_type)
# - calculate_premium(policy_details)
# - handle_claim(claim_id, action)

class TestQueryProcessor(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Setup mock data and dependencies
        self.query_processor = QueryProcessor()
        self.mock_database = Mock()
        self.query_processor.database = self.mock_database

    # Unit tests for core functions
    def test_process_query_valid(self):
        query = "Get active policies"
        expected_result = ["Policy1", "Policy2"]
        self.mock_database.execute_query.return_value = expected_result
        result = self.query_processor.process_query(query)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

    def test_process_query_invalid(self):
        query = "Invalid query"
        self.mock_database.execute_query.side_effect = ValueError("Invalid query")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            self.query_processor.process_query(query)

    # Integration tests for component interactions
    def test_verify_coverage(self):
        policy_id = "12345"
        coverage_type = "Health"
        self.mock_database.get_policy.return_value = {"id": policy_id, "coverage": ["Health", "Dental"]}
        result = self.query_processor.verify_coverage(policy_id, coverage_type)
        self.assertTrue(result)

    # Mock-based tests for external dependencies
    @patch('external_service.calculate_premium')
    def test_calculate_premium(self, mock_calculate_premium):
        policy_details = {"id": "12345", "type": "Auto", "base_premium": 100}
        mock_calculate_premium.return_value = 120
        premium = self.query_processor.calculate_premium(policy_details)
        self.assertEqual(premium, 120)

    # Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
    def test_policy_status_transitions(self):
        scenarios = [
            ("active", "expired", False),
            ("active", "cancelled", False),
            ("expired", "active", True),
        ]
        for initial_status, new_status, expected_result in scenarios:
            with self.subTest(initial_status=initial_status, new_status=new_status):
                result = self.query_processor.can_transition_status(initial_status, new_status)
                self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

    # Error handling tests
    def test_handle_claim_invalid_action(self):
        claim_id = "claim123"
        action = "invalid_action"
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            self.query_processor.handle_claim(claim_id, action)

    # Insurance domain-specific tests
    def test_claim_processing_approval(self):
        claim_id = "claim123"
        self.mock_database.get_claim_status.return_value = "filed"
        self.query_processor.handle_claim(claim_id, "approve")
        self.mock_database.update_claim_status.assert_called_with(claim_id, "approved")

    def test_coverage_verification_invalid_policy(self):
        policy_id = "invalid_policy"
        coverage_type = "Health"
        self.mock_database.get_policy.return_value = None
        result = self.query_processor.verify_coverage(policy_id, coverage_type)
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_premium_calculation_compliance(self):
        policy_details = {"id": "12345", "type": "Home", "base_premium": 200}
        premium = self.query_processor.calculate_premium(policy_details)
        self.assertGreaterEqual(premium, 200)  # Ensure compliance with minimum premium regulations

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Unit Tests**: These tests focus on individual functions like `process_query` and `verify_coverage`, ensuring they handle both valid and invalid inputs correctly.

2. **Integration Tests**: These tests check how different components interact, such as verifying coverage by fetching policy details from a mock database.

3. **Mock-Based Tests**: External dependencies like premium calculation services are mocked to isolate the test environment.

4. **Parameterized Tests**: These tests cover multiple scenarios for policy status transitions, ensuring the system handles each transition correctly.

5. **Error Handling Tests**: These tests ensure that the system raises appropriate exceptions for invalid operations, such as handling claims with invalid actions.

6. **Insurance Domain-Specific Tests**: These tests focus on scenarios specific to the insurance domain, such as claim processing and coverage verification.

This structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the query_processor component's functionality, addressing both general and insurance-specific requirements.
