## Core Components

### 1. Insurance Document Processor

**Purpose**: Automates the extraction of structured information from insurance documents to build and maintain the knowledge graph.

**Key Features**:
- Zero-shot document crawling and identification
- Entity and relationship extraction using LLMs
- Structured information conversion for graph ingestion
- Support for various document formats (PDF, Word, text)

**Input**: Raw insurance documents (policies, claims, coverage documents)
**Output**: Structured entities and relationships for the knowledge graph

### 2. Self-Evolving Graph Schema Manager

**Purpose**: Maintains and evolves the knowledge graph schema based on new data patterns.

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic schema adaptation without human intervention
- Entity and relationship type inference
- Property and constraint management
- Schema quality measurement and improvement

**Input**: Instance data from processed documents
**Output**: Optimized knowledge graph schema

### 3. Knowledge Graph

**Purpose**: Stores and manages the structured insurance domain knowledge.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-relational graph representation
- Support for complex entity and relationship properties
- Optimized for insurance-specific queries
- Versioning and temporal data support

**Input**: Structured entities and relationships from document processor
**Output**: Graph data for query execution

### 4. Query Processing System

**Purpose**: Processes natural language queries and generates appropriate responses.

**Key Features**:
- Intent recognition for insurance-specific queries
- Parameter extraction (policy numbers, dates, coverage types)
- Graph query construction and execution
- Response generation and template management

**Input**: Natural language queries from users
**Output**: Contextual responses based on knowledge graph data

### 5. Automated QA System

**Purpose**: Continuously tests and improves system performance.

**Key Features**:
- Automated test generation and execution
- Error pattern recognition
- Performance benchmarking
- System improvement recommendations

**Input**: System components and responses
**Output**: Test results, diagnostics, and improvement suggestions

### 6. Human-AI Collaboration Manager

**Purpose**: Minimizes the need for human involvement while ensuring response quality.

**Key Features**:
- Confidence-based decision making
- Exception handling patterns
- Feedback incorporation
- Continuous self-improvement

**Input**: Query processing results and confidence metrics
**Output**: Decisions on autonomous responses vs. human review

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion and Processing**:
   - Insurance documents are crawled or uploaded to the system
   - Document Processor extracts entities, relationships, and attributes
   - Extracted data is validated and normalized

2. **Schema Evolution**:
   - Schema Manager analyzes extracted data patterns
   - Identifies new entity types, properties, and relationships
   - Updates the knowledge graph schema accordingly

3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**:
   - Processed data is integrated into the knowledge graph
   - Relationships are established between entities
   - Graph indices are updated for efficient querying

4. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits natural language query
   - Query Processor identifies intent and extracts parameters
   - Constructs and executes graph query
   - Generates natural language response from results

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - QA System continuously tests system components
   - Identifies error patterns and performance issues
   - Applies fixes and improvements automatically

6. **Autonomous Response Decision**:
   - Collaboration Manager evaluates response confidence
   - Determines if response can be provided autonomously
   - Routes for human review when necessary

## Scalability Considerations

The system architecture is designed for scalability across multiple dimensions:

1. **Data Volume**: Can handle increasing numbers of insurance documents
2. **Query Complexity**: Supports simple to complex multi-hop queries
3. **Domain Coverage**: Extensible to different insurance types and regulations
4. **Performance**: Components can be optimized or replaced independently

## Security and Compliance

The architecture incorporates security and compliance considerations:

1. **Data Privacy**: Sensitive information handling with appropriate controls
2. **Compliance Rules**: Regulatory requirements encoded in response generation
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of system decisions and actions
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access for different system functions

## Future Extensions

The architecture can be extended with:

1. **Multi-modal Processing**: Support for images, audio, and video content
2. **Federated Knowledge Graphs**: Integration with external knowledge sources
3. **Personalization**: User-specific response tailoring
4. **Explainable AI**: Enhanced reasoning and explanation capabilities
