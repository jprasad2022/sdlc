Generate comprehensive test cases for the Insurance Graph RAG system's {component_name} component.

Component Details:
{component_details}

Instructions:
1. Create test cases covering all key functionality
2. Include tests for normal operation scenarios
3. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
4. Ensure coverage of insurance-specific scenarios
5. Incorporate domain knowledge about policies, claims, and coverages

Test types to include:
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Mock-based tests for external dependencies
- Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Error handling tests

Insurance domain considerations:
- Policy status transitions (active, expired, cancelled)
- Claim processing scenarios (filing, review, approval, denial)
- Coverage verification for different policy types
- Premium calculation and payment processing
- Regulatory compliance requirements

Format your output as executable Python test code using unittest framework.
