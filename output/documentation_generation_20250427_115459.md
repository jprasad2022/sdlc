# Graph Schema Documentation

## 1. Overview and Purpose

The `graph_schema` module is designed to manage the creation, updating, and versioning of knowledge graph schemas. It provides a structured approach to define entities and relationships within a graph database, ensuring consistency and integrity across different versions of the schema. The module also includes mechanisms for detecting and handling errors related to schema validation, version control, and entity/relationship detection.

## 2. Architecture and Design Decisions

The `graph_schema` module is built with a focus on modularity and extensibility. Key design decisions include:

- **Custom Exceptions**: The module defines specific exceptions (`SchemaValidationError`, `VersionControlError`, `EntityDetectionError`, and `RelationshipDetectionError`) to handle different types of errors, providing clear and actionable error messages.
  
- **Logging**: The module uses Python's built-in logging library to log important events and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

- **GraphSchemaManager Class**: This core class encapsulates all functionalities related to schema management, including creation, updating, and versioning. This design choice promotes encapsulation and separation of concerns.

## 3. API Reference with Examples

### GraphSchemaManager

#### Methods

- **create_schema**: Initializes a new schema with specified entities and relationships.
  
  ```python
  manager = GraphSchemaManager()
  manager.create_schema(entities=['Person', 'Company'], relationships=['EMPLOYS'])
  ```

- **update_schema**: Updates an existing schema with new entities or relationships.
  
  ```python
  manager.update_schema(new_entities=['Product'], new_relationships=['BUYS'])
  ```

- **validate_schema**: Validates the current schema against predefined rules.
  
  ```python
  try:
      manager.validate_schema()
  except SchemaValidationError as e:
      logger.error(f"Schema validation failed: {e}")
  ```

- **version_schema**: Manages versioning of the schema, allowing rollback and updates.
  
  ```python
  try:
      manager.version_schema(version='1.0.1')
  except VersionControlError as e:
      logger.error(f"Version control error: {e}")
  ```

#### Error Handling

Each method includes error handling to manage exceptions and log errors appropriately. For example, if schema validation fails, a `SchemaValidationError` is raised and logged.

## 4. Configuration and Deployment Guidelines

### Configuration

- **Logging**: Configure the logging level and output as needed. By default, it is set to `INFO`.
  
  ```python
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  ```

### Deployment

- Ensure that the module is deployed in an environment with access to the necessary graph database.
- Dependencies should be managed using a package manager like `pip`, and a `requirements.txt` file should be maintained.

## 5. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Maintenance

- Regularly update the module to incorporate new features and improvements.
- Monitor logs to identify and resolve issues promptly.

### Troubleshooting

- **SchemaValidationError**: Ensure that the schema adheres to all validation rules. Check for missing or incorrect entities and relationships.
- **VersionControlError**: Verify that versioning operations are performed correctly, and ensure that version identifiers are unique and sequential.
- **EntityDetectionError/RelationshipDetectionError**: Check the input data for completeness and correctness. Ensure that all entities and relationships are defined before detection.

By following this documentation, developers and system administrators can effectively utilize the `graph_schema` module to manage knowledge graph schemas, ensuring robust and scalable graph database solutions.
